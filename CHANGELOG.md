### Changed

## [[0.7.0]] - 2021-06-02 _(Marcel Jerzyk)_

### Added

- New script: [`.../merge_jsons.py`](./src/git_profiler/py_scripts/merge_jsons.py) was added to the project.

  - This script takes on input:
    - `str:` **`github_username`**,
  - Output is stored _(by default)_ in:
    - [`.data/scanned_user/`**`<username>`**`.json`](.data/scanned_user/)
  - The purpose of this script is to merge all of the `.json` files that are generated via [`.../scan_repositories.py`](./src/git_profiler/py_scripts/scan_repositories.py) script into one `.json` file that contains merged information from all of them in a 'gather' mode. This means that when in some other file information fetched by given combo of **language-linter** is present, then the results are summed up. This allows for even easier usage of the Mega Linter information via ML model because the processing work is already done.
  - The script also takes care of different `.json`-s as some of them are linter-related but others contain aggregated results.
  - Structure of the file is as follows:

    ```python
    {
      "<lang>": {
        "<linter>": {
          "errors": int,
          "files": int,
          "fixed": int
        },
        "total": {
          "clones": int,
          "duplicate_lines_num": int,
          "duplicate_tokens_num": int,
          "files": int,
          "lines": int,
          "tokens": int
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    - There's special case for `<lang>` which is **`"Total:"`** - it contains all aggregated results.
    - The `"total"` subkey doesn't always have to exist, for examples it does not in `<lang>`: `cspell`, `xml`, `yaml`.

  - Example final output:
    ```json
    {
      "Total:": {
        "total": {
          "clones": 163,
          "duplicate_lines_num": 6061,
          "duplicate_tokens_num": 52202,
          "files": 428,

          "files": 58,
          "lines": 6111,
          "tokens": 57864
        }
      },
      "spell": {
        "cspell": {
          "errors": 9555,
          "files": 640,
          "fixed": 0
        },
        "misspell": {
          "errors": 18,
          "files": 640,
          "fixed": 0
        }
      }
    }
    ```

- Added `paper` directory.
  - It contains the _LaTeX_ paper which got complete overhaul.
  - Redundant text and formatting was removed.
  - Comments that were pointless were removed and existing comments were standardized
  - Moved sections of paper to separate files.
  - Adjusted heading/title sections.
  - Resolved few errors and warnings.
  - Created directory `/img/` for images.
  - Created `/misc/` folder for all the stuff that is not tightly related to the paper or structure.

### Changed

- Script [`.../scan_repositories.py`](./src/git_profiler/py_scripts/scan_repositories.py) now fetches repositories of given user automatically _(no need to provide separate repositories list in order to fetch them)_
  - New input:
    - `str:` **`github_username`**,

## [[0.6.0]] - 2021-05-25 _(Marcel Jerzyk)_

### Added

- New script: [`.../scan_repositories.py`](./src/git_profiler/py_scripts/scan_repositories.py) was added to the project.
  - This script takes on input:
    - `str:` **`github username`**,
    - `list[str]`: **`github repositories names`**
  - It automates the repositories cloning, Mega Linter linting and Mega Linter Scraper scraping routine. It does exactly as what the intuition might suggest:
    - first starts `git clone` on every single repository name given on input
    - then it uses _MegaLinter_ to parse the repositories contents and generate na output file
    - and at the end - uses the previously made [`.../scraper.py`](./src/git_profiler/py_scripts/scraper.py) to parse the file contents into a machine-readable `.json` format
  - The output results are stored in `/data/repositories/<username>` \_(the directory will be automatically created if it's not present yet)\_
  - The script will also try to clean the repositories directory from directories generated by earlier launches.

## [[0.5.0]] - 2021-05-11 _(Marcel Jerzyk)_

### Added

- New directory: [`./docs`](./docs) containing various files regarding the technical side of the project as well as images used in markdown files.
- LaTeX document changes tracker: [`LANGv1.md`](./docs/LANGv1.md). It has previous versions of sections and subsections:
  - Systematic Review
  - Research Questions
  - Resources to Be Searched
  - Results Selection Process
  - Data Collection
  - Data Pre-processing

### Changed

- Moved directory: [`./img/readme/*`](./img/readme/) inside [`./docs`](./docs) _(now: [`./docs/img/readme/*`])_.

## [[0.4.0]] - 2021-05-11 _(Marcel Jerzyk)_

This changelog entry will be filled in a few days.

### Added

- [`data/cleaned_data.csv`](./data/cleaned_data.csv)
- [`data/questionnaire.csv`](./data/questionnaire.csv)
- [`src/gitprofiler/py_scripts/questionnaire_adjuster.py`](./src/gitprofiler/py_scripts/questionnaire_adjuster.py)

## [[0.3.0]] - 2021-05-08 _(Marcel Jerzyk)_

### Added

- New Script: [`scrape.py`](.src/gitprofiler/py_scripts/scrape.py)
  - The script takes on input output file which can be generated via [**Mega Linter**](https://github.com/nvuillam/mega-linter) by redirecting the standard output stream into a text file _(`> output.txt`)_.
  - Script parses the log data and scrapes **duplicates** table information into `dictionary`:
    ```python
    {
        "language": str,
        "files": int,         # amount of detected files in given language by linter
        "lines": int,         # amount of detected lines in a given language
        "tokens": int,        # amount of detected tokens ("chars") in a given language
        "clones": int,
        "duplicate_lines_num": int,
        "duplicate_lines_percent": float,
        "duplicate_tokens_num": int,
        "duplicate_tokens_percent": float
    },
    ```
  - Script parses the log data and scrapes **summary** table information into `dictionary`:
    ```python
    {
        "language": str,
        "linter": str,
        "files": int or str,  # amount of detected files in given language by linter
        "fixed": int,         # amount of fixed errors automatically by linter
        "errors": int         # amount of errors that could not be fixed by linter
    },
    ```
  - All available information are properly parsed and saved as `output.json` file that contains list of the previously mentioned dictionaries.
- New File: [`CHANGELOG.md`](.)
  - This file serves as a diary of the progress of the programming side of this project.

### Changed

- Added new [`README.md`](./README.md) entry about the new script file. It contains the information about the requirements needed in order to run the script as well as the run process itself with the expected output data.

## [[0.2.0]] - 2021-04-20 _(Jakub Litkowski)_

### Added

- GraphQL Query Created
- Scraped information from Query into variables:

  - Bio:

  ```r
  repositoriesNames <- json$data$repositoryOwner$repositories$edges$node$name
  bio               <- json$data$repositoryOwner$bio
  isHireable        <- json$data$repositoryOwner$isHireable
  emptyRepos        <- json$data$repositoryOwner$repositories$edges$node$isEmpty
  commitMsgE        <- json$data$repositoryOwner$repositories$edges$node$defaultBranchRef$target$history$edges
  ```

  - Commit Messages:

  ```r
  commitMSGList     <- list()
  commitDates       <- list()

  for(d in commitMsgE) {
    for(i in 1:length(d$node$author$user$login)){
      if( d$node$author$user$login[i] == "Luzkan"){
        commitDates <- c(commitDates,d$node$committedDate[i])
      }
    }
  }

  for (p in commitMsgE) {
    for(i in 1:length(p$node$author$user$login)){
      if( p$node$author$user$login[i] == "Luzkan"){
        commitMSGList <- c(commitMSGList,p$node$message[i])
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  - Used Languages:

  ```r
  languages <- json$data$repositoryOwner$repositories$edges$node$languages$edges
  languagesList <- list()

  for (l in languages) {
    print(l)
    languagesList <- c(languagesList, l$node$name )
  }
  ```

- Calculating Time Between Commits:

  ```r
  time_between_commits <- list()

  for(idx in seq_along(commitDates)){
    if (idx+1 > length(commitDates)){
        break
    }
    dateOne<-as.POSIXct(commitDates[[idx]], format = "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
    dateTwo<-as.POSIXct(commitDates[[idx+1]], format = "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
    time_between_commits[[idx]]<- as.numeric(difftime(dateOne,dateTwo, units="mins"))
  }

  average_time_between_commit <- mean(unlist(time_between_commits))
  ```

            }
            }
        }
        }
    }
    }')
  ```

  - Execution, parsing & writing to `.json` output
