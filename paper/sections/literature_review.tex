\section{Literature Review}

The ,,What skills do IT companies look for in new developers?'' \cite{StackOverflowStudies} paper gives us initial clues about the useful skills possessed by developers which are in demand by the hiring companies. Most importantly, they found that both of these skill groups are valuable in the eyes of companies. They defined both soft and technical skills which are the most valuable:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Hard Skills:} Languages, Libs & Frameworks, OS & Infrastructure, Process & Methods, Data Systems, and Development Tools
  \item \textbf{Soft Skills:} Communication, Collaboration, Problem-Solving
\end{itemize}

These findings were based on job offers which were listed on \emph{Stack Overflow} website. That should be emphasized because this website is used primarily by developers for problem-solving and discussions - the job listing functionality is there as a side feature and that could lead possibly to results that are somewhat more technical.

Paper ,,Do onboarding programs work?'' \cite{DoOnBoardingProgramsWork} by Adriaan Labuschagne and Reid Holmes, inspects deeper into the onboarding programs. They demonstrated that this practice is not as effective at transitioning new developers into long-term contributors as that might be previously speculated, although developers who after all do succeed through these programs are valuable. That's why we are aware that not every contributor to the open-source is going to be a skilled programmer, even though he could receive many tips after being mentored by a professional.
