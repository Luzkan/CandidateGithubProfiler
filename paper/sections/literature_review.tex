\section{Literature Review}

The ,,What skills do IT companies look for in new developers?'' \cite{StackOverflowStudies} paper gives us initial clues about the useful skills possessed by developers which are in demand by the hiring companies. Most importantly, they found that both of these skill groups are valuable in the eyes of companies. They defined both soft and technical skills which are the most valuable:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Hard Skills:} Languages, Libs & Frameworks, OS & Infrastructure, Process & Methods, Data Systems, and Development Tools
  \item \textbf{Soft Skills:} Communication, Collaboration, Problem-Solving
\end{itemize}

These findings were based on job offers which were listed on \emph{Stack Overflow} website. That should be emphasized because this website is used primarily by developers for problem-solving and discussions - the job listing functionality is there as a side feature and that could lead possibly to results that are somewhat more technical.
