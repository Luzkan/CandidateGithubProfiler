\noindent\textit{Context:} Nowadays it is much harder for new programmers to acquire industry experience. This trend started being noticeable at around 2018 \cite{FluffJobsRojewska18} but now - due to coronavirus pandemic - it is even more prominent \cite{MoneyLukasik2020}. Several dozen of junior programmers apply for one job offer \cite{KodillaZoellner2020} and thus there can be a need for a tool that would facilitate the identification of candidates that the employer is interested in. It is considered a good practice for Junior Developers that are seeking to be hired to have public repositories with some of their personal work. The problem is that usually recruiters does not have the knowledge to make use of that information which in fact could be very impactfull as it is literally the "show-off" of one's current skills. Right now it is completely disregarded until the later stages of recruitment phase - after the junior already passes the first recruiter look-up. Only then the repository is examined by a technical interviewer but that also could be a concern for the company as it books-out the valuable time of an expertised employee. Also there could be situations when one's CV is completely skipped due to various reasons and thus missing the chance to be employed or have his repositories examined by a professional which could prove otherwise (that one has all the  abilities and skills needed for the position).
\newline
\noindent\textit{Objective:}
This study aims to identify and investigate if its possible to acquire use-full information's from a GitHub profile that could be beneficial for recruiters in a recruitment process. If that would be proven to be effective way of measuring one's abilities and skills - maybe it could be also used by the developers themselves to atest their own potential quality.
\newline
The visible main challenge is inefficient hiring process with no accurate technical screening methodology. Overall goal is to improve the rate of recruiting highly skilled programmers by making use of the in formations that are already provided in CV's by standard.
\newline
\noindent\textit{Method:} We conducted a systematic review using a database search in Scopus and evaluated it using the quasi-gold standard procedure to identify relevant studies.
We created polls to gather information from developers own experiences and asked them to attach their GitHub profiles to the questionnaire. Then, with machine-learning based approach, we used that data to automatically evaluate the potential of a candidate by giving only the link to GitHub profile on input.
In the data sheet used to obtain data from publications we factor research questions into finer-grained ones, which are then answered on a per-publication basis. Those are then merged over a set of publications using an automated script to obtain answers to the posed research questions.
