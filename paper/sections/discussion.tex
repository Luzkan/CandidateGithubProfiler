The variables prepared for the machine learning model were not correlated with each other. No substantial correlation was observed between the percentage of duplicate lines and the time until the first job was found. Unnoteworthy although reassuring connection, which has the highest correlation among those all variables, between the experience duration and \code{WorkFindTime} is present.
