    abstract = {Context:Modern software development demands high levels of technical specialization. These conditions make IT companies focus on creating cross-functional teams, such as frontend, backend, and mobile developers. In this context, the success of software projects is highly influenced by the expertise of these teams in each field. Objective:In this paper, we investigate machine-learning based approaches to automatically identify the technical roles of open source developers. Method:For this, we first build a ground truth with 2284 developers labeled in six different roles: backend, frontend, full-stack, mobile, devops, and data science. Then, we build three different machine-learning models used to identify these roles. Results:These models presented competitive results for precision (0.88) and AUC (0.89) when identifying all six roles. Moreover, our results show that programming-languages are the most relevant features to predict the investigated roles. Conclusion:The approach proposed in this paper can assist companies during their hiring process, such as by recommending developers with the expertise required by job positions.}

  abstract="There are more and more developers as software is playing increasingly important roles in today's economic and social development. As a result, evaluating developers' expertise scientifically has become an urgent need for both Internet companies and developers. However, it seems that there is no satisfactory method to meet this demand currently. In this paper, we propose a solution to profile developers by analyzing their source code. We conduct the analysis of developers in terms of code quantity, code quality, skills, contribution, personalized commit time, and projects they participated in based on the GitLab code repositories. And we comprehensively evaluate developers' expertise from four perspectives, which are code quantity, code quality, contribution and score of projects they participated in. Compared with existing methods, our evaluation indicators are more comprehensive. We design and implement an online tool that can provide developer searching and profiling. Our tool has been used in Neusoft and Wonders Group to characterize the expertise and performance of their software developers.",
