\noindent\textit{Context:} Nowadays it is much harder for new programmers to acquire industry experience. This trend started being noticeable at around 2018 \cite{FluffJobsRojewska18} but now - due to coronavirus pandemic - it is even more prominent \cite{MoneyLukasik2020}. Several dozen of junior programmers apply for one job offer \cite{KodillaZoellner2020} and thus there can be a need for a tool that would facilitate the identification of candidates that the employer is interested in. It is considered a good practice for Junior Developers that are seeking to be hired to have public repositories with some of their personal work. The problem is that usually recruiters does not have the knowledge to make use of that information which in fact could be very impactfull as it is literally the "show-off" of one's current skills. Right now it is completely disregarded until the later stages of recruitment phase - after the junior already passes the first recruiter look-up. Only then the repository is examined by a technical interviewer but that also could be a concern for the company as it books-out the valuable time of an expertised employee. Also there could be situations when one's CV is completely skipped due to various reasons and thus missing the chance to be employed or have his repositories examined by a professional which could prove otherwise (that one has all the  abilities and skills needed for the position).
\newline
\noindent\textit{Objective:} 
This study aims to identify and investigate if its possible to acquire use-full information's from a GitHub profile that could be beneficial for recruiters in a recruitment process. If that would be proven to be effective way of measuring one's abilities and skills - maybe it could be also used by the developers themselves to atest their own potential quality. 
\newline
The visible main challenge is inefficient hiring process with no accurate technical screening methodology. Overall goal is to improve the rate of recruiting highly skilled programmers by making use of the in formations that are already provided in CV's by standard.
\newline
\noindent\textit{Method:} We conducted a systematic review using a database search in Scopus and evaluated it using the quasi-gold standard procedure to identify relevant studies. 
We created polls to gather information from developers own experiences and asked them to attach their GitHub profiles to the questionnaire. Then, with machine-learning based approach, we used that data to automatically evaluate the potential of a candidate by giving only the link to GitHub profile on input.
In the data sheet used to obtain data from publications we factor research questions into finer-grained ones, which are then answered on a per-publication basis. Those are then merged over a set of publications using an automated script to obtain answers to the posed research questions.

\section{Introduction}

While hiring practices of graduates are not thoroughly studied in the context of
the IT industry, the concept in general is well understood
Selecting the most valuable candidate for interview is an important process. While hiring practices of graduates are not thoroughly studied in the context of the IT industry, the concept in general is well understood \cite{HiringProcess}. As a standard, recruiters look through Curriculum Vitae (\emph{CV}) to categorize all candidates and call them for interview. Nowadays, to minimize the time spent on a single CV, recruiters have various pre-screening methods, listing them in order of importance \cite{SantanderCVLectureScholarship}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item employment history and previously business-related work
  \item university and academic performance
  \item listed programming abilities and other colloquially called \emph{"buzzwords"}
  \item soft skills
\end{itemize}

The CV could include a lot of important information's but the recruiter usually spends from 6 to 60 seconds at max per one application \cite{SantanderCVLectureScholarship}. It is surely not enough time to examine candidate skills correctly, more over - the recruiters usually doesn't even have the industrial knowledge to asses the skills and examine candidate's quality by browsing through "code portfolio". It is done only after the pre-screening is already done, when the filtered-out list of candidates goes to a professional technical employee that has the required knowledge and skills to examine the potential of a candidate. The information is there - various online hosting websites that allow to showcase one's code are widely used and added to the CV's - but a qualified candidate may be omitted in the pre-screening method because his cv-building skills were not good enough to pass. 

One of such hosting websites is GitHub \footnote{GitHub Website URL: https://github.com/} - it is a service supporting version control using git, which is used by programmers and developers for storing and managing theirs code-base repositories. The popularity of GitHub in 2021 is well established and still rising. Already in 2020 the website gathered over 36 million users \cite{GitHubUsers2020} and today, as of March 2021 - there are 55 million users \cite{GitHubUsers2021}. Dabbish et al. \cite{DabbishC} showed that software developers in public project on GitHub consciously manage their online reputation. They do recognise that others developers can assess their personal characteristics such as the quality of work or commitment by looking for example through their commits and judging the quality, checking the amount of forks of an project or stars. Singer et al. \cite{Singer} found that the amount of followers one have on GitHub is also an valuable information.

We recognise that the CV evaluation procedure has several shortcomings and not much has changed since 2013 \cite{Capiluppi}. These shortcomings especially apply for those who do not have any relevant work experience or formal degree. We also note that GitHub is a place storing lots of very valuable informations that could (or maybe should) be used to evaluate potential of a candidate. Various research works have confirmed that it is possible to retrieve data like technical technical role \cite{TechnicalRole}, identifying Experts in Software Libraries and Frameworks \cite{SoftwareLibraries} .Because the recruiters have very limited time available to review a single CV, we search for an machine-learning based solution that could help extract the information from GitHub by a non-expertised recruiter. This could not only reduce the amount of false-positive skips but also increase the overall quality of list of candidates after the pre-screening is done. 

\section{Systematic Review}

What distinguishes this paper among others — as we mentioned — we do recognize that the majority of recruiters does not have skills that could examine the technicality of a candidate. For example in the \emph{"Mining the Technical Roles of GitHub Users"} the survey was conducted among recruiters from StackOverflow website \footnote{StackOverflow Website URL: https://stackoverflow.com/} - which is primarily used by developers for the purposes of collaboration \& knowledge sharing. Thus, it can be concluded that the surveyed sample was exceptional among global population of recruiters as they have made extra efforts to create an account on IT-technical website and not only that - they were actively browsing it and even possibly creating extra content which made them visible and reachable by researchers. Based on the research we have conducted, there are only a few unfinished recommendation systems that use the user GitHub profile but at the same time there is some research that focuses on mining the data from the repositories.

\subsection{Research Questions}
Research questions presented below should help to understand the importance of creating such tool and also provide an information about functionality which is needed by potential future users - recruiters. What is more they should explore the general topic of recruiment and repositories as well.

Hence, we defined four research questions.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{RQ1: What skills are common when a company is looking for a developer?}\\
  Our system needs to determine wheather developer should be considered as worthy of attention. This question help to find out which skills are considered important among companies.
  \item \emph{RQ2: How repository make a good impression?}\\
  One way of assesing developer expertise is to analyse his projects. Thus, we should determine which features of repositories are the most representative ones.
  \item \emph{RQ3: How should recruitment process look like in IT?}\\
  As a result this question should porvide us with information wheater recomendation system based on repsitories is worth devoting time. 
  \item \emph{RQ4: Is Github repository used only for programming purposes?}\\
  As we all know not every object is used with authors purpose. Same situation might occure with the repositories. It is not required for them to be used only for developing purposes (some are used are a storage or for the experimental porpouses).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Search Terms}
Each reaserch questions provided us with some key words which are used to build up a search string. It allowed us to search publication in different search engines. 


\subsection{Resources to Be Searched}
Search engines used to the proces of finding proper resoures are Google Scholar and Scoupus. Results were provided with the usage of a defined search string which presents as follows :


\begin{itemize}
    \item ( skill  AND  repository  AND  ( github  OR  gitlab  OR  bitbucket ) )  OR  ( recruitment  OR  hiring  OR  interview )  AND  ( programming  AND  purpose )  AND  "Computer science"  AND  ( mining  AND  software )
\end{itemize}
They gave us a good amount of publications which needed to be filtered. Unfortunately many of them did not answear to the questions that we established and also were not in english. Google Schoolar gave us a lot of results but we took into the consideration only hundred beacause of its inaccuracy. As shown on the Fig. 1 search engines provided us with over two hundred publication. Finally we sticked with only ten valuable articles.

\begin{figure}[htp]

    \caption{Literature identification }
\end{figure}

\subsection{Results Selection Process}
Having selected a large number of studies with the search engines we screened titles and abstracts so as to exclude irrelevant papers. Subsequently, we eliminated duplicates. In consequence we obtained 28 results. Eventually, we managed to analyse all of filtered studies and choose 10 the most appropriate ones.

\section{Literature Review}
Choosed literature gives us answears to the questions asked earlier in this paper and provide us some useful informations. \\Skills which are needed from IT specialists descirbes \cite{StackOverflowStudies} based on job offers posted on Stack Overflow. They extract needed data and then define which hard and soft skills are welcome among recruiters. This study helps us to depict usefull skills and also can help young programmers to find their first dream job as a software engineer. Paper \cite{DoOnBoardingProgramsWork} gives us a very interesting look on boarding programs. It aware us that not every contribiutor to the open source systems is going to be a skilled programer. Based on this article many contributors are people who took part in a boarding program which are mentored by some master. Master gives participants many tips and helps them with their problems. Having that information we should be careful looking at repository contributors because not everyone is going to be professional. Article \cite{GitHubProfilesToJobAdv} shows us how skills extracted from job offers can be matched with developers skills extracted from repositories. Description of data scraping and how matching can be done should be useful in system which is presented in this paper.
\\Subject of repositories is discussed in \cite{MiningGitHub}, they take a deep look into the structure and usage of repositiories. This paper points out that not every repository is used for programming porpuses. Many of the repositories are abandonded few weeks after creation which causes very large actvity in first weeks but with the time passing, activity is decreasing drastically. A good amount of peple are using repositories as a storage or they simply have empty repositories as an effect of some experiments or attempts of learning. 
\\Recruitment process is described by the developers in paper \cite{HiringIsBroken} where authors collected data from actuall developers who posted their opinions on social networks. There is said that recruiment process casues a lot of stress and is not liked among developers. Programmers say that during the interview they can not show their whole potential and they are served with excercises which are not useful during normal work and do not check their actuall knowleadge. Developers criticise big companies for their ease of rejecting canditates beacause there are going to be much more candidates and it is not going to be a big mistake if they reject someone good - simply they will find someone else.
\\In recent years there have been carried out a various similar types of research concerning issues related to our study. For instance, there was created an online developer profiling tool assessing developer expertise \cite{GitLabProfilingTool}. The tool considers factors such as code quality, code quantity, contribution to rank  software engineer’s repositories and his skills as well. Evaluations of developers using greater number of features were determined as more accurate ones. However, weight of all of the indicators was equivalent, so none of them could be chosen as the most significant. Moreover, the tool is based on analysis of repositories created on GitLab which is definitely less popular than GitHub.[przypis?]
\\Furthermore, a relation between technical and social skills \cite{WhatMakesGoodDev} was explored also. In the study which aims at finding out what makes developer good we discovered that there is a lack of strong association between above types of skills, so doubtless it is extremely tough to assess soft and social skills mining GitHub repositories.
\\Generally, candidate selection process might be based on LinkedIn profile, CV and Github Profile as well \cite{CandidateSelection}. Although it could be complicated to obtain information about non-technical skills using above resources, personality traits of candidates could be accessed from analyzed transcription of a phone call.
\\In terms of identifying experts in software libraries and frameworks \cite{SoftwareLibraries} it was analyzed which features best distinguish library specialists. First of all, it was explored that the feature values are different for experts in each library. Nevertheless, the features such as number of commits are always relevant.


\section{Methodology}
In this section we defined methods, techniques, tools and processes referring to the main part of our research.
\subsection{Data Collection}
Process of data collection was divided into two steps. First step was to collect github users and data about their skills and job experiences. To do that we used Google Form in which creation of form was very easy and clear. Collected data was saved to CSV file and then properly prepared with R script. Second step was to collect data from repositories. We used usernames provided in the from and then with usage of GitHub GraphQL API we were able get to information which were considered interesting for us.
\subsection{Data Preprocessing}
Having collected dataset which was going to be used in a further phase of research we decided to preprocess the data. First and foremost,  we had to reject useless survey answers with no information about GitHub username. Subsequently, we needed to determine which features, obtained from github profiles, can be identified as the most appropriate ones.  After screening the features we also used a special tool called Mega-Linter in order to achieve more indicators about users’s repositories quality. In the end, we prepared a csv file with preprocessed data containing multiple pieces of information about GitHub users and selected features.
\subsection{Creating a Machine Learning Model}
Firstly, we decided to chose mlr package as a tool which is supposed to help us in creating a machine learning model.
