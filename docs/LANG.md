What distinguishes this paper among others - as we mentioned - we do recognise that majority of recruiters does not have skills that could examine the technicality of a candidate. For example in the \emph{"Mining the Technical Roles of GitHub Users"} the survey was conducted among recruiters from \footnote{StackOverflow Website URL: https://stackoverflow.com/} - strictly developer collaboration \& knowledge sharing website. Thus, it can be concluded that the surveyed sample was exceptional among global population of recruiters as they were interested to create an account and browse an IT-technical website. As far as we know there are examples of few not developed recommendation systems based on user Github profile but there are many papers which focus on mining data from repositories.

What distinguishes this paper among others — as we mentioned — we do **recognize** that **the** majority of recruiters does not have skills that could examine the technicality of a candidate. For example in the \emph{"Mining the Technical Roles of GitHub Users"} the survey was conducted among recruiters from **StackOverflow website** \footnote{StackOverflow Website URL: https://stackoverflow.com/} - which is **primarily used by developers for the purposes of collaboration \& knowledge sharing**. Thus, it can be concluded that the surveyed sample was exceptional among global population of recruiters **as they have made extra efforts to create an account on** IT-technical website **and not only that - they were actively browsing it and even possibly creating extra content which made them visible and reachable by researchers**. **Based on the research we have conducted, there are only a few unfinished recommendation systems that use the user GitHub profile but at the same time there is some research that focuses on mining the data from the repositories.**

Research questions presented below should help to understand the importance of creating such tool and also provide an information about functionality which is needed by potential future users - recruiters. What is more they should explore the general topic of recruiment and repositories as well.

Hence, we defined four research questions.

- \emph{RQ1: What skills are common when a company is looking for a developer?}\\
  Our system needs to determine wheather developer should be considered as worthy of attention. This question help to find out which skills are considered important among companies.
- \emph{RQ2: How repository make a good impression?}\\
  One way of assesing developer expertise is to analyse his projects. Thus, we should determine which features of repositories are the most representative ones.
- \emph{RQ3: How should recruitment process look like in IT?}\\
  As a result this question should porvide us with information wheater recomendation system based on repsitories is worth devoting time.
- \emph{RQ4: Is Github repository used only for programming purposes?}\\
  As we all know not every object is used with authors purpose. Same situation might occure with the repositories. It is not required for them to be used only for developing purposes (some are used are a storage or for the experimental porpouses).

Research questions presented below should **explain** **[d] to help understand [/d]** the importance of **[d] creating [/d]** such tool and also provide an information about **the** functionalities which **potential end user might need (i.e. - recruiters, developers themselves).** **Furthermore we also explore issues related to the recruitment itself, as well as the quality of repositories**.

Hence, we defined four research questions.

- \emph{RQ1: **What are the most common skills the company is looking for among the candidates?**}\\
  Our system needs to determine **whether** **developer is worthy of attention and if he should be considered further in the recruitment process.** **The answer to this question should explain what** skills are considered important among companies.
- \emph{RQ2: How **a given** repository **makes** a good impression?}\\
  One way of **assessing** developer expertise is to analyse his projects. Thus, we should determine which features of repositories are the most representative ones.
- \emph{RQ3: **Is it possible to get a good enough information about the candidate's potential based on the GitHub profile?**}\\
  **This** question should **provide** us with information **whether** **the recommendation** system based on **repositories** is worth devoting time.
- \emph{RQ4: Is Github repository used only for programming purposes?}\\
  **It often happens that an item is used contrary to the original intention of the author.** Same situation might **occur** with the repositories. **There is no compulsion to prohibit the use of a repository for purposes other than development.**
